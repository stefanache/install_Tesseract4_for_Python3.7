Hi,

About
------

The Tesseract OCR engine has been around since the 1980s. 
As of 2018, it now includes built-in deep learning capability making it a robust OCR tool (just keep in mind that no OCR system is perfect). 
Using Tesseract with OpenCVâ€™s EAST detector makes for a great combination.

Before at all:
---------------

I already have installed Python 3.7.7 on my windows 10 Pro (32 bits):

  cmd.exe
  
  C:\Users\{User}>python
  
Python 3.7.7 (tags/v3.7.7:d7c567b08f, Mar 10 2020, 11:52:54) [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> CTRL+Z
 
 
I intend to install Tesseract 4 for my Python 3.7.7

I seen that it work good with OpenCV

            so before that see the my installement at https://github.com/stefanache/install_OpenCV4_on_w10Pro

Base of work:
--------------

For that I use/follow  this tutorial:

     https://github.com/nikhilkumarsingh/tesseract-python


Step 1
-------

Install Tesseract-OCR as standalone system which have api interface for Python,PhP...

For Windows download installer from 

      https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
      
 I preffered this
 
      tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.0.0-alpha.20200223.exe (64 bit) 
  
 because and python is for 64 bits.
